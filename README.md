# PC Geeks
## A PC Part Trading Website
PC Geeks is a website strictly for people to sell and buy pc parts. When we created this site, we wanted to make a platform that is easy to navigate, less convoluted than CraigsList, and a channel for users to cummunicate directly in-app.



### To run the web app:
1. Use `vagrant up` to launch the VM.
2. Access `localhost:4200` on your host machine.
3. Refresh the server using the `build.sh` script.


### Features
#### Posting
PC Geeks provide a structured posting format. The seller must select the type (video card, CPU, etc..) and manufacturer of the item they are selling from a drop-down menu. Seller must also provide their preferred location of transaction which will be shown to other viewers.

#### Messaging
When a user see an item they are interested in buying/selling, they can go inside the detail page of the posting and send the other party a message. All parties are anonymous in a conversation to ensure security.

#### Rating
Inside every sales detail page, users can give feedback to the the post owner. These anonymous ratings can be seen by other users.

#### Reporting
Due to the nature of people, we also created a reporting feature to report posts that are inappropriate or misleading. The reporting feature sends an email to a admin account.
